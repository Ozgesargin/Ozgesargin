### Hi there. I am Ã–zge SargÄ±n. ðŸ‘‹

- It's my first year of information systems engineering in MuÄŸla SÄ±tkÄ± KoÃ§man University. Iâ€™m currently learning Python and Basic C.
- ðŸ¤” I'm always curious about technology so I read a lot about it. Now I've just started to learn how things work and how can I be a part of it. I am still searching and learning new things.
- In my spare time, I'm trying to improve my drawing skills and I play video games. I like to follow game news and awards.
